<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What is Lifedots?</strong><br>
    Lifedots is a minimalist life-tracking app that visualizes your remaining days based on your birthday and life expectancy. It helps you live more intentionally and prioritize the time you have left.</li>

    <li><strong>How do I update my birthday or life expectancy?</strong><br>
    You can update your personal information in the Settings screen. Tap “My Profile” and adjust your birthday or expected lifespan. Changes will be reflected immediately in your visualization.</li>

    <li><strong>How is the remaining time calculated?</strong><br>
    We calculate your estimated remaining days based on your birth date and the life expectancy you provided. The visualization is updated daily to reflect the countdown.</li>

    <li><strong>Is my data private?</strong><br>
    Yes. Lifedots stores all your data securely on your device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. Your privacy is our top priority.</li>

    <li><strong>Does Lifedots support iOS widgets?</strong><br>
    Yes! Lifedots provides a home screen widget that displays your remaining days. To activate it, add the “Lifedots Countdown” widget via your home screen customization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The widget is not updating automatically. What can I do?</strong><br>
    Ensure your device is running the latest iOS version and that widget permissions are granted. You can also open the app to trigger a refresh. Make sure background app refresh is enabled in your system settings.</li>

    <li><strong>I accidentally entered the wrong birthday. How do I reset it?</strong><br>
    Go to Settings > My Profile and update your birth date. The app will recalculate your remaining days automatically based on the new date.</li>

    <li><strong>I deleted the app. Will my data be restored when I reinstall?</strong><br>
    Currently, Lifedots data is stored locally. If you delete the app, your data will be lost. We recommend taking a screenshot or backing up important entries manually for now. Cloud sync is coming soon.</li>
</ul>
